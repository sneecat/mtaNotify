#### Based heavily on work done by [Anthony N](https://github.com/neoterix/nyc-mta-arrival-notify)

This script is a work in progress.

# MTA Notifications

This is a python library/script which takes an MTA API key, a train, and a station as input, and will return the arrival times for
said platform.

This comes from the MTA GTFS-realtime data, which is not always super accurate. Still figuring out how
to interpret vehicle updates as well as trip updates.

> TODO
short examples of script output
